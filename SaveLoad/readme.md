# SaveLoad

The original ship save/load script.  Based on Admiral MS's script released [here](https://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?topic=74716.0), subsequently upgraded by Goober5000 [here](https://www.hard-light.net/forums/index.php?topic=96939.0).

This script can be used to persist data for checkpoints in a mission, or even between missions.  In contrast to SaveLoadX, this script does not attempt to save the entire mission state; instead it only saves what you explicitly tell it to.  Also in contrast to SaveLoadX, this script can save not only ship data, but variable data as well.  By explicitly specifying a file name, SaveLoad can load data from a previous mission, providing an alternative to FSO's red-alert system.
