We appreciate modders adding their custom scripts into this repository over each modder having their own scripts repository, as we intend to simplify the process of dicovering and using custom scripts.
For this to work, a minimum of documentation is required.

1. Your script should be put in its own folder, containing a data folder which itself is structured like an FSO mod directory.
2. Each new script should be added to the table in the [readme](readme.md), with all columns approperiately filled. The description should be no longer than a few lines at most
3. If a script provides any sort of externally parsed files or configuration beyond arguments of custom SEXPs, there should be a readme.md in your script folder containing a complete documentation on how the config is expected to be formatted and what each option does.
