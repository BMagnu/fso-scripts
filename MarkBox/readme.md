#Mark Box

This script will allow the mission designer to highlight certain ships, wings and subsystems. This script does not do targetting, only highlighting. For ships and wings, brackets will be drawn around the ships at all times. An optional text string will be drawn over a ship if it has been targetted. For subsystems, brackets will only be drawn if the parent ship is targetted. A simple health bar is also drawn next to the subsystem.

A sample mission is included
