# Cloak

This script allows both the player and AI to be able to cloak. A config file (included) allows you to tweak the finer details, including if weapons or afterburner will kill the cloak, or if shields remain up. The script also includes a 'Cloaking Device' weapon that you can add to a ship's loadout, if a ship has this in their loadout they will get cloaking automatically. Otherwise a lua sexp is needed to give the cloaking ability.

2 sample missions are included
