# Prompt Box

Get a player response with the prompt box! This new version does away with ugly hud gauges and now draws bitmaps directly to the screen. The method to setting up the prompt box is now made much easier with a single lua sexp being able to initialize, set options, and populate the list of responses. Recalling player responses are now also much easier. Prompt Box v2 should be fully compatible with previous versions. See sexp documentation and the sample mission for more insight into how it all works.
