# In Mission Jump

This script will automatically do an in mission jump sequence to a selected waypoint for the player and AI. The lua sexp ``lua-jump-to`` is used to trigger this sequence. The first point on the waypoint path is used as the destination, the second point is used for orientation (relative to the first one). The sexp documentation for the sexp contains more specifics for how everything is timed. It is highly recommended that this be used with only fighters!

A sample mission is included
