#Item Drop

A system to drop items/power ups that can be used to recover health, restore ammo, or give effects like invincibility. Items can be dropped by dying ships, special containers specified by sexp, or automatically generated by spawners. There's also a system that can prioritize items when the player's health gets low (so they can more easily heal up). Example mod files are included. The exact item effects available are in the ``Items:Effect`` function.
