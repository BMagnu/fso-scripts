# Waypoint Assist

A script that assists the FREDder guide a player through waypoints. The FREDder specifies a waypoint path and a marker object, and the system will keep moving the marker object to the next waypoint when the player gets close. There's also LUASexps for telling when the waypoint is done, or how far along they are.
